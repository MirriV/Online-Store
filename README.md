# Online-Store

ONLINE STORE

The Online Store is designed to showcase various collections of designer shoes. Users are able to purchase shoes directly from the website and have it delivered to their address of choice.

The Online Store will display a Home Page, About Page, Lookbook Page and Contact Page

The chosen items in the Cart will remain in place if the user closes the website and reopens it at later stage. This website was built with the use of HTML, CSS, Javascript.

Once the users have logged in, they will be able to browse for shoes, and then choose products to add to their cart.

The Online Store is the final project of my Front End Web Development course being done through Codespace Academy.
